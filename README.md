# javascript-question-forum-project

This is a Single Page Application that I built for my FlatIron Software Engineering bootcamp project.  This web application is a Question & Answer Forum designed to allow Users to create a User account and post new questions and reply to existing questions on the forum.  The backend of the web app is built on Rails 5.2.4 (API only) and uses an SQLite3 database. The frontend is pure vanilla JavaScript.  

Instructions to Use:

To run the application you must first initiate a Rails server from the backend directory.  Then open up index.html from within your web browser and you will be presented with a Login screen and have the option to either login as an existing user or sign-up as a new user.  Once you are logged in, you will see a display of existing questions and have the option to either Ask a New Question or Reply to Existing Questions.  

Thanks for reading and enjoy the application!
